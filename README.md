Completing the 100 days of code challenge in Python

In order to get better at Python, I've undertaken a 100 days of code challenge where I'll be writing python everyday following along with a Udemy course by Angela Yu at https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

I've written my background to starting on my website at https://devopsapprentice.com/learning-to-code-in-python-day1/

I've put the code up that I've written just to keep track of all of the various projects I work on. 

Thanks,
Tim
